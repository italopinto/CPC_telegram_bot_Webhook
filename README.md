# CPC_telegram_bot_Webhook
A webhook Telegram bot deployed at Heroku. 

# Goals
* This bot aims to help students of accouting in Brazil, to easily search and download a document called "CPC".
* The bot will not work in your machine with this configuration, I made it to run on Heroku. But you can use it as an example and extend it.

# Credits
I used the incredible python Telegram bot API from ![pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI).

# Notes
* Make sure to use BOT FATHER from Telegram to create your bot and receive the TOKEN, to use in the source code.
